	<footer>The idea behind this exercise is to take an existing unsorted list, and:<br>
		a) add items to the list using the provided field.
		b) allow the user to use the Enter Key, or Enter Button to enter their item.<br>
		c) delete items from the list by clicking a delete button, and<br>
		d) line-through any finished item, leaving it on the list.<br>
		<br>
		The most important goals of this exercise is to:<br> 
		a) do all of this from within the JavaScript file ONLY,<br>
		b) without touching the HTML, and<br>
		c) without introducing any "bad practices" to my code.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		This was a very time-consuming exercise because every example, I found online,<br>even the student examples provided as solutions, either heavily modified the HTML,<br>
		deleted the provided list entirely, or used code that is considered "bad practice"<br>
		by Andrei and the JavaScript community (i.e., using "onclick" and/or "innerHTML).
